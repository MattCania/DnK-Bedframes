				<p class="text-justify leading-relaxed">
					Our journey began with a simple idea: make quality sleep accessible to everyone, no matter
					the space. We noticed how families, students, and young professionals often struggle with
					limited living areas — so we set out to create smart bed solutions that maximize comfort
					without sacrificing style.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3 text-justify leading-relaxed">
					From classic single and double bed frames to innovative double deck and loft beds, our
					products are built to last, crafted with safety and practicality in mind.
